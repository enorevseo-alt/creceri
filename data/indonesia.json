While most of the country is Muslim, Bali is predominantly Hindu, and Christian and Buddhist communities thrive as well. Festivals like Nyepi in Bali, Eid al-Fitr, and Waisak are celebrated across the islands and are fascinating to witness. \n\n You’ll also discover how much pride Indonesians take in their art. Batik textiles, wayang shadow puppetry, and gamelan music are just a few expressions of the country’s creative heritage. A friendly “Selamat Pagi” (good morning) goes a long way when greeting locals, and modest clothing is appreciated when visiting temples or rural communities.",
