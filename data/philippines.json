In fact, it's one of the best places for budget travelers in Southeast Asia. \n\n Local tour operators often run day trips for around ₱3,500 to ₱5,000 ($60 to $90), especially in Palawan and Siargao. Backpacker hostels in Cebu and Bohol offer package deals that include tours and transportation. Book during the off-season (June to September) and you’ll score even better rates. Apps like Klook and KKday are also great for finding deals, sometimes as low as ₱10,000 ($180) for three-day packages.",
